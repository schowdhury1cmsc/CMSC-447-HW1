# CMSC-447-HW1
Repo for CMSC 447 HW1 "Website"

The site was made with HTML and the Bootstrap Framework. It has 3 pages: a home page, a general info page, and a hobbies page. There is also size correction for if the site is viewed on a smaller screen or a large screen (smart phone vs pc). In addition, when the screen is small enough, there is a drag down menu (hamburger style) to navigate to the other pages. Site is local, so all files must be downloaded. Download the entire HW1 folder for ease of use.
